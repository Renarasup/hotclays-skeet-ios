## What is HotClays?

HotClays is a suite of apps for scoring trap and skeet on your iOS device. [HotClays Trap](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotclays-trap/id1338907603) is specifically designed for trap, and [HotClays Skeet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hotclays-skeet/id1364795561) is likewise specifically designed for skeet.

## How HotClays Works

1. **Manage Your Team:**
Add team members for fast squadding on score sheets. You can view sheets and station-by-station statistics for each team member.

2. **Score Your Rounds:**
Create a score sheet with an event, range, date, and squad. Optionally add notes, then start scoring a round of 25. Scoring a round is as simple as tapping 'Hit' or 'Miss' for every shot.

3. **Organize Your Rounds:**
Attach multiple rounds to a single score sheet for organized viewing and exporting. Rounds can be viewed, edited, and shared with friends via email.

4. **Share Your Scores:**
Email entire sheets or individual rounds to your friends. HotClays generates spreadsheets that can be viewed on any desktop or mobile spreadsheet client. Exported spreadsheets make it easy to store your rounds for analysis outside of the HotClays app.
