By popular demand, HotClays is now available for skeet!


HERE'S HOW HOTCLAYS WORKS

1. Manage Your Team
Add team members for fast squadding on score sheets. You can view score sheets for individual team members and station-by-station statistics.

2. Score Your Rounds
Create a score sheet with an event, range, date, and squad. Optionally add notes, then start scoring a round of 25. Scoring a round is as simple as tapping 'Hit' or 'Miss' for every shot. HotClays even keeps track of your option shot for you.

3. Organize Your Rounds
Put multiple rounds on a single score sheet for organized viewing and exporting. Rounds can be viewed, edited, and shared with friends via email.

4. Share Your Scores
Email entire sheets or individual rounds to your friends. HotClays generates spreadsheets that can be viewed on any desktop or mobile spreadsheet client. Exported spreadsheets make it easy to store your rounds for analysis outside of the HotClays app.
